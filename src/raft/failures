Lab 2A 

1. Compile Errors : Typos, wrong parameter passing
2. Index out of range 
    Was due to in a new follower could not find term in the first index 
    Because I did not initilize it 
3. Deadlock is there
    In one place was calling a function in a lock then in that function was also waiting
    for the lock

4. Not getting majority votes for any one server
5. No leader getting selected for a term
6. Multiple leaders for a term
7. Converting a Leader to follower based on the response from an old term RPC
8. Too many RPC calls
9. Timeout happening much much later than expected
10. Resseting alarm when not required
11. Know when to become a follower
12. Multiple heartbeats to a server in a single send
13. RPC's from old terms
14. Handling TimeoutAlarm for Leader
15. What does Resseting election alarm mean ?
16. Locking conditions but then calling a thread while holding the lock therby creating Deadlock
17. Checking for majority for a candidate /
18. Seperately locking conditions in the same block  i.e I have an if-else block and I lock them seperately
    and not locking the whole crotocal section


// 2B

Concurrent requests coming how to send them in order ?
Inconsistent result due to heartbeats, I was not sending heartbeats when there are no appendentries
Failure due to not applying commited entries to log, this was due to commiting entries in heartbeat. But this failed if after commiting something
Leader failed hence no heartbeat would be sent and nothing would be commited  

Locked return statement so that server failed to resond when that condition hit 

Starting agreement which are not atomic
Disconnected server do not release locks hence causing infinite log and stuck in that state

// 2C
testFigure8Unreliable is sometimes failing, from what I could get from logs its due to  not be able to apply all the logs in time

to check if this assumption is correct I will increase the time for test
